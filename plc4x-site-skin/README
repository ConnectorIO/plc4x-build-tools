PLC4X Build Tools: PLC4X Site Skin
========================

PLC4X Build Tools: PLC4X Site Skin is a sub-project of the Apache PLC4X project
and contains all the tools needed to generate the main projects website using
the maven site plugin.

Environment
-----------

Currently the project is configured to require the following software:

1) Java 8 JDK: For running Maven in general as well as compiling the Java and Scala
modules `JAVA_HOME` configured to point to that.


Getting Started
---------------

Normally you wouldn't be required to build this module as the artifacts it produces
will be made available via one of the maven repositories. However if you want to improve
or fix the existing tools, you will have to build your version locally.

You must have Java 8 installed on your system and connectivity to Maven Central
(for downloading external third party dependencies). Maven will be automatically
downloaded and installed by the maven wrapper `mvnw`.

Build PLC4X Java jars and install them in your local maven repository

$ mvn install

This should make the build-tools available to the main projects build.
In order to use your locally built version of the build-tools you should
update the property: `plc4x-code-generation.version` in the PLC4X main pom.xml.
